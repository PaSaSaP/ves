.. NOTE::
   This is the working documentation for the VNF Event Stream (VES) project.

The `OPNFV VES <https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/ves>`_ project aims to develop OPNFV platform support for VNF event streams, in a common model and format intended for use by NFV Service Providers (SPs), e.g. in managing VNF health and lifecycle. The projectâ€™s goal is to enable a significant reduction in the effort to develop and integrate VNF telemetry-related data into automated VNF management systems, by promoting convergence toward a common event stream format and collection system.

The documentation provided here focuses on the specific features supported in the Danube release.
